You have thousands of followers. Years of posts. A username people recognize. But none of it is yours.

One policy change, one algorithmic shift, one content moderation decision you never agreed to — and it can all disappear overnight. Your audience. Your voice. Your digital identity. Gone.

This isn't a hypothetical scenario. It happens every day. And it happens because the platforms you depend on were never designed to serve you. They were designed to own you.

**<WikiLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr" extract="An open protocol for censorship-resistant global networks, designed around cryptographic keypairs and relays.">Nostr</WikiLink> was built to change that.**

## The Broken Model

Every major social platform follows the same playbook:

- **They own your identity.** Your username exists at their discretion. Get banned, and you lose not just access — you lose who you are online.
- **They control what you see.** Algorithms decide which posts reach your feed, optimizing for engagement, not for what matters to you.
- **They harvest your data.** Every click, every scroll, every pause is tracked and sold to advertisers.
- **They hold your relationships hostage.** You can't take your followers with you when you leave. That's by design.

<Callout type="tip">
Think about it: if you were banned from Twitter tomorrow, could you reach the audience you built there? Could you even prove who you are?
</Callout>

This isn't a broken system. It's working exactly as intended — just not for you.

## What Is Nostr?

Nostr stands for **Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays**. It's not an app or a company. It's an open <WikiLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" extract="A system of rules that allows two or more entities to transmit information, defining the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication.">protocol</WikiLink> — a set of rules that anyone can build on.

Here's the core idea in three concepts:

- **Keys, not accounts.** Your identity is a <WikiLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" extract="A cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: a public key that can be shared freely, and a private key known only to the owner.">cryptographic keypair</WikiLink> that you generate yourself. No signup form. No email required. No company grants you permission to exist.
- **Relays, not servers.** Your posts are sent to relays — simple message servers. You can use as many as you want. If one goes down or censors you, your identity and audience remain intact.
- **NIPs, not corporate decisions.** The protocol evolves through <WikiLink href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips" extract="Nostr Implementation Possibilities — community-driven specifications that define how the Nostr protocol works.">NIPs</WikiLink> (Nostr Implementation Possibilities), open proposals that anyone can contribute to.

<Callout type="tip">
Think of Nostr like email. You can switch from Gmail to Outlook without losing your ability to send messages. Nostr does this for social media — except you also own the address.
</Callout>

## What Changes With Nostr

Here's what looks different when no company sits between you and your audience:

### Identity: Yours, Not Theirs

On traditional platforms, your identity is a username rented from a corporation. They can revoke it, shadow-ban it, or lock it behind verification paywalls.

On Nostr, your identity is a **cryptographic key that you control**. It can't be taken away. It works across every Nostr app. And it's mathematically yours — no one can impersonate you without your private key.

### Censorship: Protocol-Level Freedom

Platforms can ban you. They can suppress your posts. They can remove you from search results without telling you.

On Nostr, **no single entity can silence you**. Individual relays can choose not to carry your messages, but you can always publish to others. There is no central kill switch. The protocol itself is neutral.

### Content: Your Feed, Your Rules

Algorithms decide what you see on traditional platforms. They optimize for outrage, engagement, and ad revenue — not for what you actually want.

On Nostr, **there is no mandatory algorithm**. Clients can offer algorithmic feeds, but you choose whether to use them. Many clients let you see a pure chronological timeline of people you follow. The choice is yours.

### Data: Minimal by Design

Traditional platforms build detailed profiles of your behavior and sell that data to advertisers. Your attention is the product.

On Nostr, **the protocol doesn't require personal data**. No email, no phone number, no real name. Relays see your public messages, but there's no central database profiling your every move.

### Apps: Use Any Client You Like

On Twitter, you use Twitter's app. On Instagram, you use Instagram's app. If you don't like the interface, tough luck.

On Nostr, **your identity works across every client**. <WikiLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damus" extract="A social media application for the Nostr protocol, initially available on iOS.">Damus</WikiLink>, Amethyst, Primal, Coracle, Snort, Nostrudel — dozens of apps, all interoperable. Switch clients whenever you want without losing a single follower or post.

## The Ecosystem Is Real

Nostr isn't a whitepaper or a future promise. It's a living ecosystem with millions of users and hundreds of apps:

- **Social clients** — Damus (iOS), Amethyst (Android), Primal (web/mobile), Coracle, and more
- **Long-form content** — Habla.news and Yakihonne for blog-style publishing
- **Messaging** — Encrypted direct messages built into the protocol
- **Marketplaces** — Shopstr and Plebeian Market for decentralized commerce
- **Streaming** — Zap.stream for live broadcasts with instant Bitcoin payments
- **Payments** — Built-in Bitcoin Lightning integration for tipping (zapping) content creators directly

People are already using Nostr as their primary social network. And new apps ship every week.

## It's Not Perfect — And That's the Point

Let's be honest about the challenges. Nostr is an open protocol where anyone can participate. That means:

- **Spam exists.** Without gatekeepers, bots and low-quality content can be a problem.
- **Discovery is harder.** Without an algorithm pushing content, finding interesting accounts takes more effort.
- **Key management matters.** Lose your private key and you lose your identity. There's no "forgot password" button.

These are real trade-offs. But they're the trade-offs of freedom — and the community is actively building solutions for every one of them.

One of those solutions is **Web of Trust**. Instead of relying on a central authority to decide who's trustworthy, Web of Trust lets your social connections act as a natural filter. The people you follow become your first circle of trust, and their connections extend your network organically. It's decentralized moderation that actually works — without anyone being in charge.

## Take the First Step

Getting started with Nostr takes less than a minute:

1. **Pick a client** — Try [Primal](https://primal.net) for a familiar social media feel, or [Damus](https://damus.io) on iOS
2. **Generate your keys** — The client handles this for you. Just make sure to **save your private key** somewhere safe
3. **Follow some people** — Find communities that interest you and start building your network
4. **Explore freely** — Try different clients, switch whenever you want, and experience what social media feels like when you're in control

Your digital life should belong to you. With Nostr, it finally can.
