          "content": "\nTrust is the foundation of every online interaction. When you read a post, follow an account, or share content, you're making a judgment about who deserves your attention. But how do you make that judgment at scale, without a company deciding for you?\n\nThat's the question **Web of Trust** answers.\n\n## Trust Without Gatekeepers\n\nIn most platforms, trust is centralized. A company verifies accounts, curates feeds, and decides who gets banned. It works — until it doesn't. Censorship, bias, and opaque algorithms erode the very trust they claim to provide.\n\nWeb of Trust flips this model. Instead of a central authority, **you** are the root of your own trust network. The people you follow are your first circle of trust. The people they follow form your second circle. And so on.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nThink of it like real life. You trust your friends. You somewhat trust your friends' friends. A stranger five handshakes away? You'd probably want some proof before trusting them.\n</Callout>\n\n## How It Works\n\nWeb of Trust maps your social connections into a directed graph with measurable trust levels:\n\n- **1 hop** — People you follow directly. Highest trust.\n- **2 hops** — Friends of friends. Moderate trust.\n- **3 hops** — Two degrees removed. Lower trust.\n- **Beyond 3 hops** — Essentially unknown to your network.\n\nEach hop reduces the trust score. But it's not just about distance — the number of **paths** matters too. If five of your trusted contacts all follow the same person, that person has more credibility than someone reached through a single chain.\n\n## The Origin of the Idea\n\nWeb of Trust isn't new. <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann\" extract=\"Creator of PGP, the most widely used email encryption software in the world, and a key figure in the public-key cryptography movement.\">Phil Zimmermann</WikiLink> introduced the concept in 1991 with <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\" extract=\"An encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication, created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.\">PGP</WikiLink> (Pretty Good Privacy), a system for encrypting email. In PGP's <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust\" extract=\"A decentralized trust model used in PGP and other systems, where trust is established through a network of mutually signed keys.\">Web of Trust</WikiLink>, users signed each other's public keys to vouch for their identity. If you trusted Alice, and Alice signed Bob's key, you could reasonably trust Bob too.\n\nThe idea was revolutionary: **trust doesn't need a certificate authority. It can emerge from relationships.**\n\nNostr brings this concept into social networking. Instead of signing cryptographic keys, trust flows through **follow relationships** — a natural, low-friction signal that already exists in the protocol.\n\n## Why Nostr Needs It\n\nNostr is an open protocol. Anyone can publish. No one can be banned at the protocol level. This is its greatest strength and its biggest challenge.\n\nWithout any filtering:\n\n- Bots can flood relays with spam\n- Impersonators can copy anyone's identity\n- Low-quality content competes equally with valuable posts\n\nCentralized solutions (blocklists, admin moderation) contradict Nostr's principles. Web of Trust provides a **decentralized alternative** — each user's trust network acts as a personalized, self-sovereign filter.\n\n## Web of Trust in Practice\n\nWith [Nostr Web of Trust](/), your browser extension builds a local graph of your social connections. Any Nostr app can then query this graph to answer questions like:\n\n- **Is this person in my network?** Filter out complete strangers.\n- **How far away are they?** Prioritize closer connections.\n- **What's their trust score?** Make nuanced decisions.\n\n```javascript\n// Check if a pubkey is in your Web of Trust\nconst trusted = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Get the distance in hops\nconst distance = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Get a normalized trust score (0 to 1)\nconst score = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\nThe result: your feed reflects **your** trust judgments, not an algorithm's.\n\n## Privacy by Design\n\nA trust system that tracks your social graph could be a privacy nightmare. That's why we built three modes:\n\n- **Local Mode** — Your graph stays entirely in your browser. No server ever sees it.\n- **Remote Mode** — Queries go to our oracle server, but only pubkeys are sent. No content, no metadata.\n- **Hybrid Mode** — Cached locally with remote fallback for unknown keys.\n\nYou choose your trade-off between performance and privacy.\n\n## Beyond Filtering\n\nWeb of Trust isn't just about blocking spam. It opens up possibilities like:\n\n- **Reputation systems** — Weight content by the author's trust score\n- **Discovery** — Find valuable accounts through trusted paths\n- **Collaborative moderation** — Communities can define shared trust boundaries\n- **Relay selection** — Prefer relays used by trusted contacts\n\nThe deeper your trust graph, the more useful it becomes.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nReady to see your trust network in action?

          "content": "\nYou have thousands of followers. Years of posts. A username people recognize. But none of it is yours.\n\nOne policy change, one algorithmic shift, one content moderation decision you never agreed to — and it can all disappear overnight. Your audience. Your voice. Your digital identity. Gone.\n\nThis isn't a hypothetical scenario. It happens every day. And it happens because the platforms you depend on were never designed to serve you. They were designed to own you.\n\n**<WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr\" extract=\"An open protocol for censorship-resistant global networks, designed around cryptographic keypairs and relays.\">Nostr</WikiLink> was built to change that.**\n\n## The Broken Model\n\nEvery major social platform follows the same playbook:\n\n- **They own your identity.** Your username exists at their discretion. Get banned, and you lose not just access — you lose who you are online.\n- **They control what you see.** Algorithms decide which posts reach your feed, optimizing for engagement, not for what matters to you.\n- **They harvest your data.** Every click, every scroll, every pause is tracked and sold to advertisers.\n- **They hold your relationships hostage.** You can't take your followers with you when you leave. That's by design.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nThink about it: if you were banned from Twitter tomorrow, could you reach the audience you built there? Could you even prove who you are?\n</Callout>\n\nThis isn't a broken system. It's working exactly as intended — just not for you.\n\n## What Is Nostr?\n\nNostr stands for **Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays**. It's not an app or a company. It's an open <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol\" extract=\"A system of rules that allows two or more entities to transmit information, defining the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication.\">protocol</WikiLink> — a set of rules that anyone can build on.\n\nHere's the core idea in three concepts:\n\n- **Keys, not accounts.** Your identity is a <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\" extract=\"A cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: a public key that can be shared freely, and a private key known only to the owner.\">cryptographic keypair</WikiLink> that you generate yourself. No signup form. No email required. No company grants you permission to exist.\n- **Relays, not servers.** Your posts are sent to relays — simple message servers. You can use as many as you want. If one goes down or censors you, your identity and audience remain intact.\n- **NIPs, not corporate decisions.** The protocol evolves through <WikiLink href=\"https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips\" extract=\"Nostr Implementation Possibilities — community-driven specifications that define how the Nostr protocol works.\">NIPs</WikiLink> (Nostr Implementation Possibilities), open proposals that anyone can contribute to.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nThink of Nostr like email. You can switch from Gmail to Outlook without losing your ability to send messages. Nostr does this for social media — except you also own the address.\n</Callout>\n\n## What Changes With Nostr\n\nHere's what looks different when no company sits between you and your audience:\n\n### Identity: Yours, Not Theirs\n\nOn traditional platforms, your identity is a username rented from a corporation. They can revoke it, shadow-ban it, or lock it behind verification paywalls.\n\nOn Nostr, your identity is a **cryptographic key that you control**. It can't be taken away. It works across every Nostr app. And it's mathematically yours — no one can impersonate you without your private key.\n\n### Censorship: Protocol-Level Freedom\n\nPlatforms can ban you. They can suppress your posts. They can remove you from search results without telling you.\n\nOn Nostr, **no single entity can silence you**. Individual relays can choose not to carry your messages, but you can always publish to others. There is no central kill switch. The protocol itself is neutral.\n\n### Content: Your Feed, Your Rules\n\nAlgorithms decide what you see on traditional platforms. They optimize for outrage, engagement, and ad revenue — not for what you actually want.\n\nOn Nostr, **there is no mandatory algorithm**. Clients can offer algorithmic feeds, but you choose whether to use them. Many clients let you see a pure chronological timeline of people you follow. The choice is yours.\n\n### Data: Minimal by Design\n\nTraditional platforms build detailed profiles of your behavior and sell that data to advertisers. Your attention is the product.\n\nOn Nostr, **the protocol doesn't require personal data**. No email, no phone number, no real name. Relays see your public messages, but there's no central database profiling your every move.\n\n### Apps: Use Any Client You Like\n\nOn Twitter, you use Twitter's app. On Instagram, you use Instagram's app. If you don't like the interface, tough luck.\n\nOn Nostr, **your identity works across every client**. <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damus\" extract=\"A social media application for the Nostr protocol, initially available on iOS.\">Damus</WikiLink>, Amethyst, Primal, Coracle, Snort, Nostrudel — dozens of apps, all interoperable. Switch clients whenever you want without losing a single follower or post.\n\n## The Ecosystem Is Real\n\nNostr isn't a whitepaper or a future promise. It's a living ecosystem with millions of users and hundreds of apps:\n\n- **Social clients** — Damus (iOS), Amethyst (Android), Primal (web/mobile), Coracle, and more\n- **Long-form content** — Habla.news and Yakihonne for blog-style publishing\n- **Messaging** — Encrypted direct messages built into the protocol\n- **Marketplaces** — Shopstr and Plebeian Market for decentralized commerce\n- **Streaming** — Zap.stream for live broadcasts with instant Bitcoin payments\n- **Payments** — Built-in Bitcoin Lightning integration for tipping (zapping) content creators directly\n\nPeople are already using Nostr as their primary social network. And new apps ship every week.\n\n## It's Not Perfect — And That's the Point\n\nLet's be honest about the challenges. Nostr is an open protocol where anyone can participate. That means:\n\n- **Spam exists.** Without gatekeepers, bots and low-quality content can be a problem.\n- **Discovery is harder.** Without an algorithm pushing content, finding interesting accounts takes more effort.\n- **Key management matters.** Lose your private key and you lose your identity. There's no \"forgot password\" button.\n\nThese are real trade-offs. But they're the trade-offs of freedom — and the community is actively building solutions for every one of them.\n\nOne of those solutions is **Web of Trust**. Instead of relying on a central authority to decide who's trustworthy, Web of Trust lets your social connections act as a natural filter. The people you follow become your first circle of trust, and their connections extend your network organically. It's decentralized moderation that actually works — without anyone being in charge. You can [learn more about how it works](/blog/what-is-web-of-trust) or [try it yourself](/download).\n\n## Take the First Step\n\nGetting started with Nostr takes less than a minute:\n\n1. **Pick a client** — Try [Primal](https://primal.net) for a familiar social media feel, or [Damus](https://damus.io) on iOS\n2. **Generate your keys** — The client handles this for you. Just make sure to **save your private key** somewhere safe\n3. **Follow some people** — Find communities that interest you and start building your network\n4. **Explore freely** — Try different clients, switch whenever you want, and experience what social media feels like when you're in control\n\nYour digital life should belong to you. With Nostr, it finally can.\n\n---\n\n*Have questions? Find us on [Nostr](https://njump.me/npub1gxdhmu9swqduwhr6zptjy4ya693zp3ql28nemy4hd97kuufyrqdqwe5zfk) or check our [documentation](/docs).*\n"

          "content": "\nYour Web of Trust is more than just a list of people you follow. It's a living network of connections, trust relationships, and social paths that define who you trust and why. But until now, you could only imagine what it looked like.\n\n**Enter the Playground.**\n\n## See Your Trust Network Come to Life\n\nThe Playground transforms your abstract social graph into a visual, interactive experience. Every person in your network becomes a node. Every follow relationship becomes a connection. And trust levels? They're painted right on the canvas.\n\n### Trust Levels, Color-Coded\n\nAt a glance, you can see who you trust most:\n\n- **Blue** — That's you, the root of your network\n- **Green** — High trust (70%+), usually people you follow directly\n- **Yellow** — Medium trust (30-70%), friends of friends\n- **Red** — Low trust (under 30%), distant connections on the edge of your network\n\nThe color system makes it instantly clear where someone stands in your trust hierarchy. No numbers to parse, no lists to scan—just intuitive visual feedback.\n\n## Understanding Hops and Paths\n\nThe Playground organizes your network by **distance**—how many hops it takes to reach someone from you.\n\n- **1 hop**: People you follow directly (100% distance weight)\n- **2 hops**: Friends of friends (50% weight)\n- **3 hops**: Two degrees removed (25% weight)\n- **4+ hops**: Extended network (10% weight)\n\nBut distance isn't everything. The system also considers **paths**—how many different routes lead to the same person. If you follow someone, and three of your friends also follow them, that's four paths. More paths mean more trust.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nWhen you select a node, you'll see details like \"2 hops · 4 paths · 65% trust\"—giving you the full context of how that person relates to your network.\n</Callout>\n\n## Expand and Explore\n\nThe real power of the Playground is **interactive expansion**. You don't see the entire network at once—that would be overwhelming. Instead:\n\n1. **Start with yourself** as the root node\n2. **Click to expand** and load your direct follows\n3. **Click any node** to expand their connections\n4. **Go deeper**, up to 3 hops into the network\n\nThis on-demand loading means you can explore exactly the parts of your network that interest you, without waiting for thousands of nodes to load upfront.\n\n## Choose Your Dimension: 2D or 3D\n\nEveryone thinks differently. Some prefer a flat, fast overview. Others want to dive into an immersive space. The Playground supports both:\n\n### 2D Mode\n\nThe 2D view renders on a canvas with nodes arranged in concentric circles by hop distance. It's fast, responsive, and can handle up to 10,000 nodes. Perfect for:\n\n- Quick overviews of your network structure\n- Finding specific people\n- Performance on lower-end devices\n\n### 3D Mode\n\nThe 3D view uses WebGL to render your network in three-dimensional space. Orbit around, zoom in, and explore your network like navigating a galaxy. Great for:\n\n- Immersive exploration\n- Understanding complex connection patterns\n- Discovering clusters and communities\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nIn 3D mode, use left-drag to rotate, right-drag to pan, and scroll to zoom. Node sizes are based on trust—larger nodes are more trusted.\n</Callout>\n\n## Filter and Focus\n\nLarge networks can get noisy. The Playground gives you tools to filter down to what matters:\n\n- **Trust Threshold**: Only show nodes above a certain trust percentage\n- **Distance Limit**: Cap the maximum hops displayed (1-5)\n- **Edge Types**: Toggle follows, mutes, or show only mutual connections\n- **Search**: Find specific people by name or pubkey\n\nCombine these filters to answer questions like \"Who are my highly-trusted connections within 2 hops?\" or \"Show me only mutual follows.\"\n\n## Why Visualization Matters\n\nSeeing your trust network isn't just cool—it's useful. You can:\n\n- **Spot trusted bridges** who connect different parts of your network\n- **Discover clusters** of people who all know each other\n- **Identify outliers** who might be worth following directly\n- **Understand your reach** into different communities\n\nThe Web of Trust is a powerful concept, but it becomes truly intuitive when you can see it.\n\n## Try It Now\n\nReady to see your network? Head to the [Playground](/playground) and start exploring. Connect your Nostr account, and watch your trust network unfold before your eyes.\n\n---\n\n*Questions or feedback?

          "content": "\nThe Nostr ecosystem is growing rapidly. Every day, thousands of new users join the network, creating notes, sharing content, and building connections. But with this growth comes a familiar challenge: **how do you separate signal from noise?**\n\n## The Problem with Open Networks\n\nOpen, permissionless networks are powerful precisely because anyone can participate. But this openness also means dealing with:\n\n- **Spam and bot accounts** flooding your feed\n- **Impersonators** pretending to be someone they're not\n- **Low-quality content** drowning out valuable discussions\n\nTraditional solutions rely on centralized moderation—a team deciding what's acceptable. But that defeats the purpose of a decentralized network.\n\n## Enter Web of Trust\n\nWeb of Trust takes a different approach. Instead of relying on a central authority, it leverages something you already have: **your social connections**.\n\nThe concept is simple:\n\n1. **You trust the people you follow**\n2. **They trust the people they follow**\n3. **Trust flows through these connections**\n\nIf someone is 1 hop away (you follow them directly), they're highly trusted. 2 hops away (a friend of a friend), somewhat trusted. 3 or more hops? Probably noise.\n\n```javascript\n// Check if someone is in your Web of Trust\nconst inNetwork = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Get their exact distance\nconst hops = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Get a trust score (0-1)\nconst score = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nOur browser extension builds a local graph of your social connections. When you visit any Nostr app, it can query this graph to determine trust levels for any pubkey.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nThe extension works with any Nostr app that implements the WoT API. No changes needed to your favorite client!\n</Callout>\n\n### Privacy First\n\nWe designed the system with privacy as a core principle:\n\n- **Local Mode**: Everything stays in your browser. Zero external requests.\n- **Remote Mode**: Only pubkey lookups—no content, no tracking.\n- **Hybrid Mode**: Best of both worlds with caching.\n\n## What's Next\n\nThis is just the beginning. We're working on:\n\n- **SDK for developers** to integrate WoT into their apps\n- **Oracle server** for apps that can't run client-side computations\n- **Advanced scoring** with mutual follows and bridging bonuses\n\n## Get Started\n\nReady to try it? [Download the extension](/download) and start filtering your Nostr experience based on real human connections.\n\n---\n\n*Have questions?

          "ogImage": "/images/blog/why-nostr/og.jpg",
          "content": "\nTienes miles de seguidores. Años de publicaciones. Un nombre de usuario que la gente reconoce. Pero nada de eso es tuyo.\n\nUn cambio de política, un ajuste algorítmico, una decisión de moderación con la que nunca estuviste de acuerdo — y todo puede desaparecer de la noche a la mañana. Tu audiencia. Tu voz. Tu identidad digital. Desaparecida.\n\nEsto no es un escenario hipotético. Sucede todos los días. Y sucede porque las plataformas de las que dependes nunca fueron diseñadas para servirte. Fueron diseñadas para ser dueñas de ti.\n\n**<WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr\" extract=\"Un protocolo abierto para redes globales resistentes a la censura, diseñado en torno a pares de claves criptográficas y relays.\">Nostr</WikiLink> fue construido para cambiar eso.**\n\n## El Modelo Roto\n\nTodas las grandes plataformas sociales siguen el mismo patrón:\n\n- **Son dueñas de tu identidad.** Tu nombre de usuario existe a su discreción. Si te banean, no solo pierdes acceso — pierdes quién eres en internet.\n- **Controlan lo que ves.** Los algoritmos deciden qué publicaciones llegan a tu feed, optimizando para el engagement, no para lo que te importa.\n- **Recolectan tus datos.** Cada clic, cada scroll, cada pausa es rastreada y vendida a anunciantes.\n- **Tienen tus relaciones como rehenes.** No puedes llevarte a tus seguidores cuando te vas. Eso es intencional.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPiénsalo: si te banearan de Twitter mañana, ¿podrías llegar a la audiencia que construiste ahí? ¿Podrías siquiera demostrar quién eres?\n</Callout>\n\nEsto no es un sistema roto. Funciona exactamente como fue diseñado — solo que no para ti.\n\n## ¿Qué Es Nostr?\n\nNostr significa **Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays** (Notas y Otras Cosas Transmitidas por Relays). No es una app ni una empresa. Es un <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol\" extract=\"Un sistema de reglas que permite a dos o más entidades transmitir información, definiendo la sintaxis, semántica y sincronización de la comunicación.\">protocolo</WikiLink> abierto — un conjunto de reglas sobre las que cualquiera puede construir.\n\nLa idea central en tres conceptos:\n\n- **Claves, no cuentas.** Tu identidad es un <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\" extract=\"Un sistema criptográfico que usa pares de claves: una clave pública que se puede compartir libremente y una clave privada conocida solo por el propietario.\">par de claves criptográficas</WikiLink> que generas tú mismo. Sin formulario de registro. Sin email requerido. Ninguna empresa te da permiso para existir.\n- **Relays, no servidores.** Tus publicaciones se envían a relays — servidores de mensajes simples. Puedes usar tantos como quieras. Si uno cae o te censura, tu identidad y audiencia permanecen intactas.\n- **NIPs, no decisiones corporativas.** El protocolo evoluciona a través de <WikiLink href=\"https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips\" extract=\"Nostr Implementation Possibilities — especificaciones impulsadas por la comunidad que definen cómo funciona el protocolo Nostr.\">NIPs</WikiLink> (Nostr Implementation Possibilities), propuestas abiertas a las que cualquiera puede contribuir.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPiensa en Nostr como el email. Puedes cambiar de Gmail a Outlook sin perder tu capacidad de enviar mensajes. Nostr hace esto para las redes sociales — excepto que también eres dueño de la dirección.\n</Callout>\n\n## Qué Cambia Con Nostr\n\nAsí se ve cuando ninguna empresa se interpone entre tú y tu audiencia:\n\n### Identidad: Tuya, No de Ellos\n\nEn las plataformas tradicionales, tu identidad es un nombre de usuario alquilado a una corporación. Pueden revocarlo, shadowbanearte o bloquearlo detrás de pagos de verificación.\n\nEn Nostr, tu identidad es una **clave criptográfica que tú controlas**. No te la pueden quitar. Funciona en todas las apps de Nostr. Y es matemáticamente tuya — nadie puede suplantarte sin tu clave privada.\n\n### Censura: Libertad a Nivel de Protocolo\n\nLas plataformas pueden banearte. Pueden suprimir tus publicaciones. Pueden removerte de los resultados de búsqueda sin avisarte.\n\nEn Nostr, **ninguna entidad puede silenciarte**. Los relays individuales pueden elegir no transmitir tus mensajes, pero siempre puedes publicar en otros. No hay un interruptor central. El protocolo mismo es neutral.\n\n### Contenido: Tu Feed, Tus Reglas\n\nLos algoritmos deciden lo que ves en las plataformas tradicionales. Optimizan para la indignación, el engagement y los ingresos publicitarios — no para lo que realmente quieres.\n\nEn Nostr, **no hay algoritmo obligatorio**. Los clientes pueden ofrecer feeds algorítmicos, pero tú eliges si usarlos. Muchos clientes te permiten ver una línea de tiempo cronológica pura de las personas que sigues. La elección es tuya.\n\n### Datos: Mínimos por Diseño\n\nLas plataformas tradicionales construyen perfiles detallados de tu comportamiento y venden esos datos a anunciantes. Tu atención es el producto.\n\nEn Nostr, **el protocolo no requiere datos personales**. Sin email, sin número de teléfono, sin nombre real. Los relays ven tus mensajes públicos, pero no hay una base de datos central perfilando cada uno de tus movimientos.\n\n### Apps: Usa el Cliente que Quieras\n\nEn Twitter, usas la app de Twitter. En Instagram, usas la app de Instagram. Si no te gusta la interfaz, mala suerte.\n\nEn Nostr, **tu identidad funciona en todos los clientes**. <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damus\" extract=\"Una aplicación de redes sociales para el protocolo Nostr, inicialmente disponible en iOS.\">Damus</WikiLink>, Amethyst, Primal, Coracle, Snort, Nostrudel — docenas de apps, todas interoperables. Cambia de cliente cuando quieras sin perder un solo seguidor o publicación.\n\n## El Ecosistema Es Real\n\nNostr no es un whitepaper ni una promesa futura. Es un ecosistema vivo con millones de usuarios y cientos de apps:\n\n- **Clientes sociales** — Damus (iOS), Amethyst (Android), Primal (web/móvil), Coracle, y más\n- **Contenido largo** — Habla.news y Yakihonne para publicación estilo blog\n- **Mensajería** — Mensajes directos cifrados integrados en el protocolo\n- **Mercados** — Shopstr y Plebeian Market para comercio descentralizado\n- **Streaming** — Zap.stream para transmisiones en vivo con pagos instantáneos en Bitcoin\n- **Pagos** — Integración nativa de Bitcoin Lightning para propinas (zaps) directas a creadores de contenido\n\nLa gente ya está usando Nostr como su red social principal. Y nuevas apps se lanzan cada semana.\n\n## No Es Perfecto — Y Ese Es el Punto\n\nSeamos honestos sobre los desafíos. Nostr es un protocolo abierto donde cualquiera puede participar. Eso significa:\n\n- **El spam existe.** Sin guardianes, los bots y el contenido de baja calidad pueden ser un problema.\n- **El descubrimiento es más difícil.** Sin un algoritmo empujando contenido, encontrar cuentas interesantes requiere más esfuerzo.\n- **La gestión de claves importa.** Pierde tu clave privada y pierdes tu identidad. No hay botón de \"olvidé mi contraseña\".\n\nEstos son compromisos reales. Pero son los compromisos de la libertad — y la comunidad está construyendo activamente soluciones para cada uno de ellos.\n\nUna de esas soluciones es **Web of Trust**. En lugar de depender de una autoridad central para decidir quién es confiable, Web of Trust permite que tus conexiones sociales actúen como un filtro natural. Las personas que sigues se convierten en tu primer círculo de confianza, y sus conexiones extienden tu red orgánicamente. Es moderación descentralizada que realmente funciona — sin que nadie esté a cargo. Puedes [aprender más sobre cómo funciona](/blog/que-es-web-of-trust) o [probarlo tú mismo](/download).\n\n## Da el Primer Paso\n\nEmpezar con Nostr toma menos de un minuto:\n\n1. **Elige un cliente** — Prueba [Primal](https://primal.net) para una experiencia familiar de red social, o [Damus](https://damus.io) en iOS\n2. **Genera tus claves** — El cliente se encarga de esto. Solo asegúrate de **guardar tu clave privada** en un lugar seguro\n3. **Sigue a algunas personas** — Encuentra comunidades que te interesen y empieza a construir tu red\n4. **Explora libremente** — Prueba diferentes clientes, cambia cuando quieras, y experimenta cómo se siente una red social cuando tú tienes el control\n\nTu vida digital debería pertenecerte. Con Nostr, finalmente puede.\n\n---\n\n*¿Tienes preguntas?

          "ogImage": "/images/blog/what-is-wot/og.jpg",
          "content": "\nLa confianza es la base de toda interacción online. Cuando lees una publicación, sigues una cuenta o compartes contenido, estás juzgando quién merece tu atención. Pero ¿cómo haces ese juicio a escala, sin que una empresa decida por ti?\n\nEsa es la pregunta que **Web of Trust** responde.\n\n## Confianza Sin Guardianes\n\nEn la mayoría de las plataformas, la confianza está centralizada. Una empresa verifica cuentas, cura feeds y decide quién es baneado. Funciona — hasta que deja de funcionar. La censura, el sesgo y los algoritmos opacos erosionan la misma confianza que dicen proporcionar.\n\nWeb of Trust invierte este modelo. En lugar de una autoridad central, **tú** eres la raíz de tu propia red de confianza. Las personas que sigues son tu primer círculo de confianza. Las personas que ellos siguen forman tu segundo círculo. Y así sucesivamente.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPiénsalo como en la vida real. Confías en tus amigos. Confías algo en los amigos de tus amigos. ¿Un desconocido a cinco apretones de mano? Probablemente querrías alguna prueba antes de confiar en él.\n</Callout>\n\n## Cómo Funciona\n\nWeb of Trust mapea tus conexiones sociales en un grafo dirigido con niveles de confianza medibles:\n\n- **1 salto** — Personas que sigues directamente. Mayor confianza.\n- **2 saltos** — Amigos de amigos. Confianza moderada.\n- **3 saltos** — A dos grados de separación. Menor confianza.\n- **Más de 3 saltos** — Esencialmente desconocidos para tu red.\n\nCada salto reduce el puntaje de confianza. Pero no se trata solo de distancia — la cantidad de **caminos** también importa. Si cinco de tus contactos de confianza siguen a la misma persona, esa persona tiene más credibilidad que alguien al que se llega por una sola cadena.\n\n## El Origen de la Idea\n\nWeb of Trust no es nuevo. <WikiLink href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann\" extract=\"Creador de PGP, el software de cifrado de correo electrónico más utilizado del mundo, y una figura clave en el movimiento de criptografía de clave pública.\">Phil Zimmermann</WikiLink> introdujo el concepto en 1991 con <WikiLink href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\" extract=\"Un programa de cifrado que proporciona privacidad criptográfica y autenticación para la comunicación de datos, creado por Phil Zimmermann en 1991.\">PGP</WikiLink> (Pretty Good Privacy), un sistema para cifrar correo electrónico. En el <WikiLink href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust\" extract=\"Un modelo de confianza descentralizado usado en PGP y otros sistemas, donde la confianza se establece a través de una red de claves mutuamente firmadas.\">Web of Trust</WikiLink> de PGP, los usuarios firmaban las claves públicas de otros para avalar su identidad. Si confiabas en Alice, y Alice firmaba la clave de Bob, podías razonablemente confiar en Bob también.\n\nLa idea fue revolucionaria: **la confianza no necesita una autoridad certificadora. Puede emerger de las relaciones.**\n\nNostr lleva este concepto a las redes sociales. En lugar de firmar claves criptográficas, la confianza fluye a través de **relaciones de seguimiento** — una señal natural y sin fricción que ya existe en el protocolo.\n\n## Por Qué Nostr Lo Necesita\n\nNostr es un protocolo abierto. Cualquiera puede publicar. Nadie puede ser baneado a nivel de protocolo. Esta es su mayor fortaleza y su mayor desafío.\n\nSin ningún filtrado:\n\n- Los bots pueden inundar los relays con spam\n- Los impostores pueden copiar la identidad de cualquiera\n- El contenido de baja calidad compite en igualdad con publicaciones valiosas\n\nLas soluciones centralizadas (listas de bloqueo, moderación de admins) contradicen los principios de Nostr. Web of Trust proporciona una **alternativa descentralizada** — la red de confianza de cada usuario actúa como un filtro personalizado y auto-soberano.\n\n## Web of Trust en la Práctica\n\nCon [Nostr Web of Trust](/), tu extensión de navegador construye un grafo local de tus conexiones sociales. Cualquier app de Nostr puede consultar este grafo para responder preguntas como:\n\n- **¿Está esta persona en mi red?** Filtra a los completos desconocidos.\n- **¿A qué distancia está?** Prioriza las conexiones más cercanas.\n- **¿Cuál es su puntaje de confianza?** Toma decisiones con matices.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifica si un pubkey está en tu Web of Trust\nconst confiable = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén la distancia en saltos\nconst distancia = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén un puntaje de confianza normalizado (0 a 1)\nconst puntaje = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\nEl resultado: tu feed refleja **tus** juicios de confianza, no los de un algoritmo.\n\n## Privacidad por Diseño\n\nUn sistema de confianza que rastrea tu grafo social podría ser una pesadilla de privacidad. Por eso construimos tres modos:\n\n- **Modo Local** — Tu grafo permanece enteramente en tu navegador. Ningún servidor lo ve jamás.\n- **Modo Remoto** — Las consultas van a nuestro servidor oracle, pero solo se envían pubkeys. Sin contenido, sin metadatos.\n- **Modo Híbrido** — Caché local con respaldo remoto para claves desconocidas.\n\nTú eliges tu equilibrio entre rendimiento y privacidad.\n\n## Más Allá del Filtrado\n\nWeb of Trust no se trata solo de bloquear spam. Abre posibilidades como:\n\n- **Sistemas de reputación** — Pondera el contenido por el puntaje de confianza del autor\n- **Descubrimiento** — Encuentra cuentas valiosas a través de caminos de confianza\n- **Moderación colaborativa** — Las comunidades pueden definir límites de confianza compartidos\n- **Selección de relays** — Prefiere relays usados por contactos de confianza\n\nCuanto más profundo tu grafo de confianza, más útil se vuelve.\n\n## Pruébalo Tú Mismo\n\n¿Listo para ver tu red de confianza en acción?

Están pintados directamente en el lienzo.\n\n### Niveles de Confianza Codificados por Color\n\nDe un vistazo, puedes ver en quién confías más:\n\n- **Azul** — Eres tú, la raíz de tu red\n- **Verde** — Alta confianza (70%+), generalmente personas que sigues directamente\n- **Amarillo** — Confianza media (30-70%), amigos de amigos\n- **Rojo** — Baja confianza (menos del 30%), conexiones distantes en el borde de tu red\n\nEl sistema de colores hace instantáneamente claro dónde se ubica alguien en tu jerarquía de confianza. Sin números que analizar, sin listas que escanear—solo retroalimentación visual intuitiva.\n\n## Entendiendo Saltos y Caminos\n\nEl Playground organiza tu red por **distancia**—cuántos saltos se necesitan para llegar a alguien desde ti.\n\n- **1 salto**: Personas que sigues directamente (100% de peso de distancia)\n- **2 saltos**: Amigos de amigos (50% de peso)\n- **3 saltos**: Dos grados de separación (25% de peso)\n- **4+ saltos**: Red extendida (10% de peso)\n\nPero la distancia no lo es todo. El sistema también considera **caminos**—cuántas rutas diferentes llevan a la misma persona. Si sigues a alguien, y tres de tus amigos también lo siguen, eso son cuatro caminos. Más caminos significan más confianza.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nCuando seleccionas un nodo, verás detalles como \"2 saltos · 4 caminos · 65% confianza\"—dándote el contexto completo de cómo esa persona se relaciona con tu red.\n</Callout>\n\n## Expande y Explora\n\nEl verdadero poder del Playground es la **expansión interactiva**. No ves toda la red de una vez—eso sería abrumador. En cambio:\n\n1. **Comienza contigo mismo** como el nodo raíz\n2. **Haz clic para expandir** y cargar tus seguidores directos\n3. **Haz clic en cualquier nodo** para expandir sus conexiones\n4. **Profundiza**, hasta 3 saltos en la red\n\nEsta carga bajo demanda significa que puedes explorar exactamente las partes de tu red que te interesan, sin esperar a que miles de nodos se carguen de antemano.\n\n## Elige Tu Dimensión: 2D o 3D\n\nCada persona piensa diferente. Algunos prefieren una vista plana y rápida. Otros quieren sumergirse en un espacio inmersivo. El Playground soporta ambos:\n\n### Modo 2D\n\nLa vista 2D renderiza en un lienzo con nodos organizados en círculos concéntricos por distancia de saltos. Es rápida, responsiva y puede manejar hasta 10,000 nodos. Perfecta para:\n\n- Vistas generales rápidas de la estructura de tu red\n- Encontrar personas específicas\n- Rendimiento en dispositivos de gama baja\n\n### Modo 3D\n\nLa vista 3D usa WebGL para renderizar tu red en espacio tridimensional. Orbita alrededor, acércate y explora tu red como si navegaras una galaxia. Ideal para:\n\n- Exploración inmersiva\n- Entender patrones de conexión complejos\n- Descubrir clusters y comunidades\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nEn modo 3D, usa arrastrar-izquierdo para rotar, arrastrar-derecho para desplazar y scroll para zoom. Los tamaños de los nodos se basan en la confianza—nodos más grandes son más confiables.\n</Callout>\n\n## Filtra y Enfoca\n\nLas redes grandes pueden ser ruidosas. El Playground te da herramientas para filtrar lo que importa:\n\n- **Umbral de Confianza**: Solo muestra nodos por encima de cierto porcentaje de confianza\n- **Límite de Distancia**: Limita los saltos máximos mostrados (1-5)\n- **Tipos de Conexión**: Alterna entre seguidores, silenciados, o muestra solo conexiones mutuas\n- **Búsqueda**: Encuentra personas específicas por nombre o pubkey\n\nCombina estos filtros para responder preguntas como \"¿Quiénes son mis conexiones de alta confianza dentro de 2 saltos?\" o \"Muéstrame solo los seguidores mutuos.\"\n\n## Por Qué Importa la Visualización\n\nVer tu red de confianza no es solo genial—es útil. Puedes:\n\n- **Detectar puentes de confianza** que conectan diferentes partes de tu red\n- **Descubrir clusters** de personas que se conocen entre sí\n- **Identificar valores atípicos** que podrían valer la pena seguir directamente\n- **Entender tu alcance** hacia diferentes comunidades\n\nWeb of Trust es un concepto poderoso, pero se vuelve verdaderamente intuitivo cuando puedes verlo.\n\n## Pruébalo Ahora\n\n¿Listo para ver tu red? Ve al [Playground](/playground) y comienza a explorar. Conecta tu cuenta de Nostr y observa cómo tu red de confianza se despliega ante tus ojos.\n\n---\n\n*¿Preguntas o comentarios?

Pero con este crecimiento viene un desafío familiar: **¿cómo separas la señal del ruido?**\n\n## El Problema con las Redes Abiertas\n\nLas redes abiertas y sin permisos son poderosas precisamente porque cualquiera puede participar. Pero esta apertura también significa lidiar con:\n\n- **Spam y cuentas bot** inundando tu feed\n- **Impostores** pretendiendo ser alguien que no son\n- **Contenido de baja calidad** ahogando discusiones valiosas\n\nLas soluciones tradicionales dependen de la moderación centralizada—un equipo decidiendo qué es aceptable. Pero eso contradice el propósito de una red descentralizada.\n\n## Llega Web of Trust\n\nWeb of Trust toma un enfoque diferente. En lugar de depender de una autoridad central, aprovecha algo que ya tienes: **tus conexiones sociales**.\n\nEl concepto es simple:\n\n1. **Confías en las personas que sigues**\n2. **Ellas confían en las personas que siguen**\n3. **La confianza fluye a través de estas conexiones**\n\nSi alguien está a 1 salto (los sigues directamente), son altamente confiables. ¿A 2 saltos (amigo de un amigo)? Algo confiables. ¿3 o más saltos? Probablemente ruido.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifica si alguien está en tu Web of Trust\nconst enRed = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén su distancia exacta\nconst saltos = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén un puntaje de confianza (0-1)\nconst puntaje = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\n## Cómo Funciona\n\nNuestra extensión de navegador construye un grafo local de tus conexiones sociales. Cuando visitas cualquier app de Nostr, puede consultar este grafo para determinar niveles de confianza para cualquier pubkey.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\n¡La extensión funciona con cualquier app de Nostr que implemente la API de WoT. No se necesitan cambios en tu cliente favorito!\n</Callout>\n\n### Privacidad Primero\n\nDiseñamos el sistema con la privacidad como principio fundamental:\n\n- **Modo Local**: Todo permanece en tu navegador. Cero solicitudes externas.\n- **Modo Remoto**: Solo consultas de pubkey—sin contenido, sin rastreo.\n- **Modo Híbrido**: Lo mejor de ambos mundos con caché.\n\n## ¿Qué Sigue?\n\nEsto es solo el comienzo. Estamos trabajando en:\n\n- **SDK para desarrolladores** para integrar WoT en sus apps\n- **Servidor Oracle** para apps que no pueden ejecutar cálculos del lado del cliente\n- **Puntuación avanzada** con seguidores mutuos y bonificaciones de puente\n\n## Comienza\n\n¿Listo para probarlo?

          "content": "\nA confiança é a base de toda interação online. Quando você lê uma publicação, segue uma conta ou compartilha conteúdo, está fazendo um julgamento sobre quem merece sua atenção. Mas como fazer esse julgamento em escala, sem que uma empresa decida por você?\n\nEssa é a pergunta que o **Web of Trust** responde.\n\n## Confiança Sem Guardiões\n\nNa maioria das plataformas, a confiança é centralizada. Uma empresa verifica contas, cura feeds e decide quem é banido. Funciona — até parar de funcionar. Censura, viés e algoritmos opacos corroem a mesma confiança que dizem fornecer.\n\nWeb of Trust inverte esse modelo. Em vez de uma autoridade central, **você** é a raiz da sua própria rede de confiança. As pessoas que você segue são seu primeiro círculo de confiança. As pessoas que elas seguem formam seu segundo círculo. E assim por diante.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPense nisso como na vida real. Você confia nos seus amigos. Confia um pouco nos amigos dos seus amigos. Um estranho a cinco apertos de mão de distância? Provavelmente você ia querer alguma prova antes de confiar nele.\n</Callout>\n\n## Como Funciona\n\nWeb of Trust mapeia suas conexões sociais em um grafo direcionado com níveis de confiança mensuráveis:\n\n- **1 salto** — Pessoas que você segue diretamente. Maior confiança.\n- **2 saltos** — Amigos de amigos. Confiança moderada.\n- **3 saltos** — Dois graus de separação. Menor confiança.\n- **Além de 3 saltos** — Essencialmente desconhecidos para sua rede.\n\nCada salto reduz a pontuação de confiança. Mas não se trata apenas de distância — a quantidade de **caminhos** também importa. Se cinco dos seus contatos de confiança seguem a mesma pessoa, essa pessoa tem mais credibilidade do que alguém alcançado por uma única cadeia.\n\n## A Origem da Ideia\n\nWeb of Trust não é novo. <WikiLink href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann\" extract=\"Criador do PGP, o software de criptografia de e-mail mais utilizado do mundo, e uma figura-chave no movimento de criptografia de chave pública.\">Phil Zimmermann</WikiLink> introduziu o conceito em 1991 com <WikiLink href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP\" extract=\"Um programa de criptografia que fornece privacidade criptográfica e autenticação para comunicação de dados, criado por Phil Zimmermann em 1991.\">PGP</WikiLink> (Pretty Good Privacy), um sistema para criptografar e-mail. No <WikiLink href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_de_confiança\" extract=\"Um modelo de confiança descentralizado usado no PGP e outros sistemas, onde a confiança é estabelecida através de uma rede de chaves mutuamente assinadas.\">Web of Trust</WikiLink> do PGP, os usuários assinavam as chaves públicas uns dos outros para atestar suas identidades. Se você confiava na Alice, e Alice assinava a chave do Bob, você podia razoavelmente confiar no Bob também.\n\nA ideia foi revolucionária: **a confiança não precisa de uma autoridade certificadora. Ela pode emergir dos relacionamentos.**\n\nO Nostr traz esse conceito para as redes sociais. Em vez de assinar chaves criptográficas, a confiança flui através de **relações de seguimento** — um sinal natural e sem fricção que já existe no protocolo.\n\n## Por Que o Nostr Precisa Disso\n\nO Nostr é um protocolo aberto. Qualquer um pode publicar. Ninguém pode ser banido no nível do protocolo. Essa é sua maior força e seu maior desafio.\n\nSem nenhuma filtragem:\n\n- Bots podem inundar relays com spam\n- Impostores podem copiar a identidade de qualquer pessoa\n- Conteúdo de baixa qualidade compete igualmente com publicações valiosas\n\nSoluções centralizadas (listas de bloqueio, moderação de admins) contradizem os princípios do Nostr. Web of Trust fornece uma **alternativa descentralizada** — a rede de confiança de cada usuário age como um filtro personalizado e auto-soberano.\n\n## Web of Trust na Prática\n\nCom o [Nostr Web of Trust](/), sua extensão de navegador constrói um grafo local das suas conexões sociais. Qualquer app Nostr pode consultar esse grafo para responder perguntas como:\n\n- **Essa pessoa está na minha rede?** Filtre completos desconhecidos.\n- **A que distância ela está?** Priorize conexões mais próximas.\n- **Qual é a pontuação de confiança?** Tome decisões com nuances.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifique se um pubkey está no seu Web of Trust\nconst confiavel = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha a distância em saltos\nconst distancia = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha uma pontuação de confiança normalizada (0 a 1)\nconst pontuacao = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\nO resultado: seu feed reflete **seus** julgamentos de confiança, não os de um algoritmo.\n\n## Privacidade por Design\n\nUm sistema de confiança que rastreia seu grafo social poderia ser um pesadelo de privacidade. Por isso construímos três modos:\n\n- **Modo Local** — Seu grafo permanece inteiramente no seu navegador. Nenhum servidor jamais o vê.\n- **Modo Remoto** — As consultas vão para nosso servidor oracle, mas apenas pubkeys são enviados. Sem conteúdo, sem metadados.\n- **Modo Híbrido** — Cache local com fallback remoto para chaves desconhecidas.\n\nVocê escolhe seu equilíbrio entre desempenho e privacidade.\n\n## Além da Filtragem\n\nWeb of Trust não é apenas sobre bloquear spam. Abre possibilidades como:\n\n- **Sistemas de reputação** — Pondere conteúdo pela pontuação de confiança do autor\n- **Descoberta** — Encontre contas valiosas através de caminhos de confiança\n- **Moderação colaborativa** — Comunidades podem definir limites de confiança compartilhados\n- **Seleção de relays** — Prefira relays usados por contatos de confiança\n\nQuanto mais profundo seu grafo de confiança, mais útil ele se torna.\n\n## Experimente Você Mesmo\n\nPronto para ver sua rede de confiança em ação?

Mas nada disso é seu.\n\nUma mudança de política, um ajuste algorítmico, uma decisão de moderação com a qual você nunca concordou — e tudo pode desaparecer da noite para o dia. Sua audiência. Sua voz. Sua identidade digital. Desaparecida.\n\nIsso não é um cenário hipotético. Acontece todos os dias. E acontece porque as plataformas das quais você depende nunca foram projetadas para te servir. Foram projetadas para serem donas de você.\n\n**<WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr\" extract=\"Um protocolo aberto para redes globais resistentes à censura, projetado em torno de pares de chaves criptográficas e relays.\">Nostr</WikiLink> foi construído para mudar isso.**\n\n## O Modelo Quebrado\n\nTodas as grandes plataformas sociais seguem o mesmo padrão:\n\n- **Elas são donas da sua identidade.** Seu nome de usuário existe por decisão delas. Se você for banido, não perde apenas o acesso — perde quem você é na internet.\n- **Elas controlam o que você vê.** Algoritmos decidem quais publicações chegam ao seu feed, otimizando para engajamento, não para o que importa para você.\n- **Elas coletam seus dados.** Cada clique, cada scroll, cada pausa é rastreada e vendida para anunciantes.\n- **Elas mantêm seus relacionamentos como reféns.** Você não pode levar seus seguidores quando sai. Isso é intencional.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPense nisso: se você fosse banido do Twitter amanhã, conseguiria alcançar a audiência que construiu lá? Conseguiria sequer provar quem você é?\n</Callout>\n\nIsso não é um sistema quebrado. Funciona exatamente como foi projetado — só que não para você.\n\n## O Que É Nostr?\n\nNostr significa **Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays** (Notas e Outras Coisas Transmitidas por Relays). Não é um app nem uma empresa. É um <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol\" extract=\"Um sistema de regras que permite a duas ou mais entidades transmitir informação, definindo a sintaxe, semântica e sincronização da comunicação.\">protocolo</WikiLink> aberto — um conjunto de regras sobre as quais qualquer pessoa pode construir.\n\nA ideia central em três conceitos:\n\n- **Chaves, não contas.** Sua identidade é um <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\" extract=\"Um sistema criptográfico que usa pares de chaves: uma chave pública que pode ser compartilhada livremente e uma chave privada conhecida apenas pelo proprietário.\">par de chaves criptográficas</WikiLink> que você mesmo gera. Sem formulário de cadastro. Sem email necessário. Nenhuma empresa te dá permissão para existir.\n- **Relays, não servidores.** Suas publicações são enviadas para relays — servidores de mensagens simples. Você pode usar quantos quiser. Se um cair ou te censurar, sua identidade e audiência permanecem intactas.\n- **NIPs, não decisões corporativas.** O protocolo evolui através de <WikiLink href=\"https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips\" extract=\"Nostr Implementation Possibilities — especificações impulsionadas pela comunidade que definem como o protocolo Nostr funciona.\">NIPs</WikiLink> (Nostr Implementation Possibilities), propostas abertas nas quais qualquer pessoa pode contribuir.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPense no Nostr como o email. Você pode trocar do Gmail para o Outlook sem perder sua capacidade de enviar mensagens. Nostr faz isso para as redes sociais — exceto que você também é dono do endereço.\n</Callout>\n\n## O Que Muda Com Nostr\n\nÉ assim que funciona quando nenhuma empresa fica entre você e sua audiência:\n\n### Identidade: Sua, Não Deles\n\nNas plataformas tradicionais, sua identidade é um nome de usuário alugado de uma corporação. Eles podem revogá-lo, shadowbaní-lo ou bloqueá-lo atrás de paywalls de verificação.\n\nNo Nostr, sua identidade é uma **chave criptográfica que você controla**. Não podem tirá-la de você. Funciona em todos os apps de Nostr. E é matematicamente sua — ninguém pode se passar por você sem sua chave privada.\n\n### Censura: Liberdade no Nível do Protocolo\n\nPlataformas podem te banir. Podem suprimir suas publicações. Podem te remover dos resultados de busca sem te avisar.\n\nNo Nostr, **nenhuma entidade pode te silenciar**. Relays individuais podem escolher não transmitir suas mensagens, mas você sempre pode publicar em outros. Não há um interruptor central. O protocolo em si é neutro.\n\n### Conteúdo: Seu Feed, Suas Regras\n\nAlgoritmos decidem o que você vê nas plataformas tradicionais. Eles otimizam para indignação, engajamento e receita publicitária — não para o que você realmente quer.\n\nNo Nostr, **não há algoritmo obrigatório**. Os clientes podem oferecer feeds algorítmicos, mas você escolhe se quer usá-los. Muitos clientes permitem ver uma linha do tempo cronológica pura das pessoas que você segue. A escolha é sua.\n\n### Dados: Mínimos por Design\n\nPlataformas tradicionais constroem perfis detalhados do seu comportamento e vendem esses dados para anunciantes. Sua atenção é o produto.\n\nNo Nostr, **o protocolo não exige dados pessoais**. Sem email, sem número de telefone, sem nome real. Os relays veem suas mensagens públicas, mas não há um banco de dados central perfilando cada movimento seu.\n\n### Apps: Use Qualquer Cliente\n\nNo Twitter, você usa o app do Twitter. No Instagram, você usa o app do Instagram. Se não gosta da interface, azar o seu.\n\nNo Nostr, **sua identidade funciona em todos os clientes**. <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damus\" extract=\"Um aplicativo de rede social para o protocolo Nostr, inicialmente disponível no iOS.\">Damus</WikiLink>, Amethyst, Primal, Coracle, Snort, Nostrudel — dezenas de apps, todos interoperáveis. Troque de cliente quando quiser sem perder um único seguidor ou publicação.\n\n## O Ecossistema É Real\n\nNostr não é um whitepaper nem uma promessa futura. É um ecossistema vivo com milhões de usuários e centenas de apps:\n\n- **Clientes sociais** — Damus (iOS), Amethyst (Android), Primal (web/mobile), Coracle, e mais\n- **Conteúdo longo** — Habla.news e Yakihonne para publicação estilo blog\n- **Mensagens** — Mensagens diretas criptografadas integradas ao protocolo\n- **Mercados** — Shopstr e Plebeian Market para comércio descentralizado\n- **Streaming** — Zap.stream para transmissões ao vivo com pagamentos instantâneos em Bitcoin\n- **Pagamentos** — Integração nativa de Bitcoin Lightning para gorjetas (zaps) diretas a criadores de conteúdo\n\nAs pessoas já estão usando Nostr como sua rede social principal. E novos apps são lançados toda semana.\n\n## Não É Perfeito — E Esse É o Ponto\n\nVamos ser honestos sobre os desafios. Nostr é um protocolo aberto onde qualquer pessoa pode participar. Isso significa:\n\n- **Spam existe.** Sem guardiões, bots e conteúdo de baixa qualidade podem ser um problema.\n- **Descoberta é mais difícil.** Sem um algoritmo empurrando conteúdo, encontrar contas interessantes exige mais esforço.\n- **Gestão de chaves importa.** Perca sua chave privada e você perde sua identidade. Não há botão de \"esqueci minha senha\".\n\nEsses são compromissos reais. Mas são os compromissos da liberdade — e a comunidade está ativamente construindo soluções para cada um deles.\n\nUma dessas soluções é o **Web of Trust**. Em vez de depender de uma autoridade central para decidir quem é confiável, o Web of Trust permite que suas conexões sociais atuem como um filtro natural. As pessoas que você segue se tornam seu primeiro círculo de confiança, e as conexões delas estendem sua rede organicamente. É moderação descentralizada que realmente funciona — sem que ninguém esteja no comando. Você pode [aprender mais sobre como funciona](/blog/o-que-e-web-of-trust) ou [experimentar você mesmo](/download).\n\n## Dê o Primeiro Passo\n\nComeçar com Nostr leva menos de um minuto:\n\n1. **Escolha um cliente** — Experimente [Primal](https://primal.net) para uma experiência familiar de rede social, ou [Damus](https://damus.io) no iOS\n2. **Gere suas chaves** — O cliente cuida disso. Apenas certifique-se de **salvar sua chave privada** em um lugar seguro\n3. **Siga algumas pessoas** — Encontre comunidades que te interessam e comece a construir sua rede\n4. **Explore livremente** — Experimente diferentes clientes, troque quando quiser, e sinta como é uma rede social quando você está no controle\n\nSua vida digital deveria pertencer a você. Com Nostr, finalmente pode.\n\n---\n\n*Tem perguntas?

          "content": "\nSeu Web of Trust é mais do que uma simples lista de pessoas que você segue. É uma rede viva de conexões, relacionamentos de confiança e caminhos sociais que definem em quem você confia e por quê. Mas até agora, você só podia imaginar como ela se parecia.\n\n**Conheça o Playground.**\n\n## Veja Sua Rede de Confiança Ganhar Vida\n\nO Playground transforma seu grafo social abstrato em uma experiência visual e interativa. Cada pessoa na sua rede se torna um nó. Cada relacionamento de seguimento se torna uma conexão. E os níveis de confiança? Estão pintados diretamente na tela.\n\n### Níveis de Confiança Codificados por Cor\n\nDe relance, você pode ver em quem mais confia:\n\n- **Azul** — É você, a raiz da sua rede\n- **Verde** — Alta confiança (70%+), geralmente pessoas que você segue diretamente\n- **Amarelo** — Confiança média (30-70%), amigos de amigos\n- **Vermelho** — Baixa confiança (menos de 30%), conexões distantes na borda da sua rede\n\nO sistema de cores torna instantaneamente claro onde alguém está na sua hierarquia de confiança. Sem números para analisar, sem listas para examinar—apenas feedback visual intuitivo.\n\n## Entendendo Saltos e Caminhos\n\nO Playground organiza sua rede por **distância**—quantos saltos são necessários para alcançar alguém a partir de você.\n\n- **1 salto**: Pessoas que você segue diretamente (100% de peso de distância)\n- **2 saltos**: Amigos de amigos (50% de peso)\n- **3 saltos**: Dois graus de separação (25% de peso)\n- **4+ saltos**: Rede estendida (10% de peso)\n\nMas distância não é tudo. O sistema também considera **caminhos**—quantas rotas diferentes levam à mesma pessoa. Se você segue alguém, e três dos seus amigos também seguem, são quatro caminhos. Mais caminhos significam mais confiança.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nQuando você seleciona um nó, verá detalhes como \"2 saltos · 4 caminhos · 65% confiança\"—dando o contexto completo de como essa pessoa se relaciona com sua rede.\n</Callout>\n\n## Expanda e Explore\n\nO verdadeiro poder do Playground é a **expansão interativa**. Você não vê toda a rede de uma vez—isso seria avassalador. Em vez disso:\n\n1. **Comece com você mesmo** como o nó raiz\n2. **Clique para expandir** e carregar seus seguidores diretos\n3. **Clique em qualquer nó** para expandir suas conexões\n4. **Vá mais fundo**, até 3 saltos na rede\n\nEsse carregamento sob demanda significa que você pode explorar exatamente as partes da sua rede que lhe interessam, sem esperar milhares de nós carregarem antecipadamente.\n\n## Escolha Sua Dimensão: 2D ou 3D\n\nCada pessoa pensa diferente. Alguns preferem uma visão plana e rápida. Outros querem mergulhar em um espaço imersivo. O Playground suporta ambos:\n\n### Modo 2D\n\nA visualização 2D renderiza em uma tela com nós organizados em círculos concêntricos por distância de saltos. É rápida, responsiva e pode lidar com até 10.000 nós. Perfeita para:\n\n- Visões gerais rápidas da estrutura da sua rede\n- Encontrar pessoas específicas\n- Performance em dispositivos de menor capacidade\n\n### Modo 3D\n\nA visualização 3D usa WebGL para renderizar sua rede em espaço tridimensional. Orbite, aproxime e explore sua rede como se navegasse uma galáxia. Ideal para:\n\n- Exploração imersiva\n- Entender padrões de conexão complexos\n- Descobrir clusters e comunidades\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nNo modo 3D, use arrastar-esquerdo para rotacionar, arrastar-direito para deslocar e scroll para zoom. Os tamanhos dos nós são baseados na confiança—nós maiores são mais confiáveis.\n</Callout>\n\n## Filtre e Foque\n\nRedes grandes podem ser ruidosas. O Playground oferece ferramentas para filtrar o que importa:\n\n- **Limite de Confiança**: Mostre apenas nós acima de certa porcentagem de confiança\n- **Limite de Distância**: Limite os saltos máximos exibidos (1-5)\n- **Tipos de Conexão**: Alterne entre seguidores, silenciados, ou mostre apenas conexões mútuas\n- **Busca**: Encontre pessoas específicas por nome ou pubkey\n\nCombine esses filtros para responder perguntas como \"Quem são minhas conexões de alta confiança dentro de 2 saltos?\" ou \"Mostre-me apenas os seguidores mútuos.\"\n\n## Por Que a Visualização Importa\n\nVer sua rede de confiança não é apenas legal—é útil. Você pode:\n\n- **Identificar pontes de confiança** que conectam diferentes partes da sua rede\n- **Descobrir clusters** de pessoas que se conhecem\n- **Identificar outliers** que podem valer a pena seguir diretamente\n- **Entender seu alcance** em diferentes comunidades\n\nWeb of Trust é um conceito poderoso, mas se torna verdadeiramente intuitivo quando você pode vê-lo.\n\n## Experimente Agora\n\nPronto para ver sua rede? Vá ao [Playground](/playground) e comece a explorar. Conecte sua conta Nostr e observe sua rede de confiança se desdobrar diante dos seus olhos.\n\n---\n\n*Perguntas ou feedback?

          "content": "\nO ecossistema Nostr está crescendo rapidamente. Todos os dias, milhares de novos usuários entram na rede, criando notas, compartilhando conteúdo e construindo conexões. Mas com esse crescimento vem um desafio familiar: **como você separa o sinal do ruído?**\n\n## O Problema com Redes Abertas\n\nRedes abertas e sem permissão são poderosas precisamente porque qualquer um pode participar. Mas essa abertura também significa lidar com:\n\n- **Spam e contas bot** inundando seu feed\n- **Impostores** fingindo ser alguém que não são\n- **Conteúdo de baixa qualidade** afogando discussões valiosas\n\nSoluções tradicionais dependem de moderação centralizada—uma equipe decidindo o que é aceitável. Mas isso contradiz o propósito de uma rede descentralizada.\n\n## Entra o Web of Trust\n\nWeb of Trust adota uma abordagem diferente. Em vez de depender de uma autoridade central, ele aproveita algo que você já tem: **suas conexões sociais**.\n\nO conceito é simples:\n\n1. **Você confia nas pessoas que segue**\n2. **Elas confiam nas pessoas que seguem**\n3. **A confiança flui através dessas conexões**\n\nSe alguém está a 1 salto de distância (você os segue diretamente), são altamente confiáveis. 2 saltos (amigo de um amigo)? Algo confiáveis. 3 ou mais saltos? Provavelmente ruído.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifique se alguém está no seu Web of Trust\nconst naRede = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha a distância exata\nconst saltos = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha uma pontuação de confiança (0-1)\nconst pontuacao = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\n## Como Funciona\n\nNossa extensão de navegador constrói um grafo local das suas conexões sociais. Quando você visita qualquer app Nostr, ela pode consultar esse grafo para determinar níveis de confiança para qualquer pubkey.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nA extensão funciona com qualquer app Nostr que implemente a API WoT. Não são necessárias mudanças no seu cliente favorito!\n</Callout>\n\n### Privacidade em Primeiro Lugar\n\nProjetamos o sistema com privacidade como princípio fundamental:\n\n- **Modo Local**: Tudo permanece no seu navegador. Zero requisições externas.\n- **Modo Remoto**: Apenas consultas de pubkey—sem conteúdo, sem rastreamento.\n- **Modo Híbrido**: O melhor dos dois mundos com cache.\n\n## O Que Vem a Seguir\n\nIsso é apenas o começo. Estamos trabalhando em:\n\n- **SDK para desenvolvedores** para integrar WoT em seus apps\n- **Servidor Oracle** para apps que não podem executar cálculos do lado do cliente\n- **Pontuação avançada** com seguidores mútuos e bônus de ponte\n\n## Comece Agora\n\nPronto para experimentar? [Baixe a extensão](/download) e comece a filtrar sua experiência no Nostr baseado em conexões humanas reais.\n\n---\n\n*Tem perguntas?
