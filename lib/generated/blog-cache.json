          "content": "\nTrust is the foundation of every online interaction. When you read a post, follow an account, or share content, you're making a judgment about who deserves your attention. But how do you make that judgment at scale, without a company deciding for you?\n\nThat's the question **Web of Trust** answers.\n\n## Trust Without Gatekeepers\n\nIn most platforms, trust is centralized. A company verifies accounts, curates feeds, and decides who gets banned. It works — until it doesn't. Censorship, bias, and opaque algorithms erode the very trust they claim to provide.\n\nWeb of Trust flips this model. Instead of a central authority, **you** are the root of your own trust network. The people you follow are your first circle of trust. The people they follow form your second circle. And so on.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nThink of it like real life. You trust your friends. You somewhat trust your friends' friends. A stranger five handshakes away? You'd probably want some proof before trusting them.\n</Callout>\n\n## How It Works\n\nWeb of Trust maps your social connections into a directed graph with measurable trust levels:\n\n- **1 hop** — People you follow directly. Highest trust.\n- **2 hops** — Friends of friends. Moderate trust.\n- **3 hops** — Two degrees removed. Lower trust.\n- **Beyond 3 hops** — Essentially unknown to your network.\n\nEach hop reduces the trust score. But it's not just about distance — the number of **paths** matters too. If five of your trusted contacts all follow the same person, that person has more credibility than someone reached through a single chain.\n\n## The Origin of the Idea\n\nWeb of Trust isn't new. <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann\" extract=\"Creator of PGP, the most widely used email encryption software in the world, and a key figure in the public-key cryptography movement.\">Phil Zimmermann</WikiLink> introduced the concept in 1991 with <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\" extract=\"An encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication, created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.\">PGP</WikiLink> (Pretty Good Privacy), a system for encrypting email. In PGP's <WikiLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust\" extract=\"A decentralized trust model used in PGP and other systems, where trust is established through a network of mutually signed keys.\">Web of Trust</WikiLink>, users signed each other's public keys to vouch for their identity. If you trusted Alice, and Alice signed Bob's key, you could reasonably trust Bob too.\n\nThe idea was revolutionary: **trust doesn't need a certificate authority. It can emerge from relationships.**\n\nNostr brings this concept into social networking. Instead of signing cryptographic keys, trust flows through **follow relationships** — a natural, low-friction signal that already exists in the protocol.\n\n## Why Nostr Needs It\n\nNostr is an open protocol. Anyone can publish. No one can be banned at the protocol level. This is its greatest strength and its biggest challenge.\n\nWithout any filtering:\n\n- Bots can flood relays with spam\n- Impersonators can copy anyone's identity\n- Low-quality content competes equally with valuable posts\n\nCentralized solutions (blocklists, admin moderation) contradict Nostr's principles. Web of Trust provides a **decentralized alternative** — each user's trust network acts as a personalized, self-sovereign filter.\n\n## Web of Trust in Practice\n\nWith [Nostr Web of Trust](/), your browser extension builds a local graph of your social connections. Any Nostr app can then query this graph to answer questions like:\n\n- **Is this person in my network?** Filter out complete strangers.\n- **How far away are they?** Prioritize closer connections.\n- **What's their trust score?** Make nuanced decisions.\n\n```javascript\n// Check if a pubkey is in your Web of Trust\nconst trusted = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Get the distance in hops\nconst distance = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Get a normalized trust score (0 to 1)\nconst score = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\nThe result: your feed reflects **your** trust judgments, not an algorithm's.\n\n## Privacy by Design\n\nA trust system that tracks your social graph could be a privacy nightmare. That's why we built three modes:\n\n- **Local Mode** — Your graph stays entirely in your browser. No server ever sees it.\n- **Remote Mode** — Queries go to our oracle server, but only pubkeys are sent. No content, no metadata.\n- **Hybrid Mode** — Cached locally with remote fallback for unknown keys.\n\nYou choose your trade-off between performance and privacy.\n\n## Beyond Filtering\n\nWeb of Trust isn't just about blocking spam. It opens up possibilities like:\n\n- **Reputation systems** — Weight content by the author's trust score\n- **Discovery** — Find valuable accounts through trusted paths\n- **Collaborative moderation** — Communities can define shared trust boundaries\n- **Relay selection** — Prefer relays used by trusted contacts\n\nThe deeper your trust graph, the more useful it becomes.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nReady to see your trust network in action?

          "content": "\nYour Web of Trust is more than just a list of people you follow. It's a living network of connections, trust relationships, and social paths that define who you trust and why. But until now, you could only imagine what it looked like.\n\n**Enter the Playground.**\n\n## See Your Trust Network Come to Life\n\nThe Playground transforms your abstract social graph into a visual, interactive experience. Every person in your network becomes a node. Every follow relationship becomes a connection. And trust levels? They're painted right on the canvas.\n\n### Trust Levels, Color-Coded\n\nAt a glance, you can see who you trust most:\n\n- **Blue** — That's you, the root of your network\n- **Green** — High trust (70%+), usually people you follow directly\n- **Yellow** — Medium trust (30-70%), friends of friends\n- **Red** — Low trust (under 30%), distant connections on the edge of your network\n\nThe color system makes it instantly clear where someone stands in your trust hierarchy. No numbers to parse, no lists to scan—just intuitive visual feedback.\n\n## Understanding Hops and Paths\n\nThe Playground organizes your network by **distance**—how many hops it takes to reach someone from you.\n\n- **1 hop**: People you follow directly (100% distance weight)\n- **2 hops**: Friends of friends (50% weight)\n- **3 hops**: Two degrees removed (25% weight)\n- **4+ hops**: Extended network (10% weight)\n\nBut distance isn't everything. The system also considers **paths**—how many different routes lead to the same person. If you follow someone, and three of your friends also follow them, that's four paths. More paths mean more trust.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nWhen you select a node, you'll see details like \"2 hops · 4 paths · 65% trust\"—giving you the full context of how that person relates to your network.\n</Callout>\n\n## Expand and Explore\n\nThe real power of the Playground is **interactive expansion**. You don't see the entire network at once—that would be overwhelming. Instead:\n\n1. **Start with yourself** as the root node\n2. **Click to expand** and load your direct follows\n3. **Click any node** to expand their connections\n4. **Go deeper**, up to 3 hops into the network\n\nThis on-demand loading means you can explore exactly the parts of your network that interest you, without waiting for thousands of nodes to load upfront.\n\n## Choose Your Dimension: 2D or 3D\n\nEveryone thinks differently. Some prefer a flat, fast overview. Others want to dive into an immersive space. The Playground supports both:\n\n### 2D Mode\n\nThe 2D view renders on a canvas with nodes arranged in concentric circles by hop distance. It's fast, responsive, and can handle up to 10,000 nodes. Perfect for:\n\n- Quick overviews of your network structure\n- Finding specific people\n- Performance on lower-end devices\n\n### 3D Mode\n\nThe 3D view uses WebGL to render your network in three-dimensional space. Orbit around, zoom in, and explore your network like navigating a galaxy. Great for:\n\n- Immersive exploration\n- Understanding complex connection patterns\n- Discovering clusters and communities\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nIn 3D mode, use left-drag to rotate, right-drag to pan, and scroll to zoom. Node sizes are based on trust—larger nodes are more trusted.\n</Callout>\n\n## Filter and Focus\n\nLarge networks can get noisy. The Playground gives you tools to filter down to what matters:\n\n- **Trust Threshold**: Only show nodes above a certain trust percentage\n- **Distance Limit**: Cap the maximum hops displayed (1-5)\n- **Edge Types**: Toggle follows, mutes, or show only mutual connections\n- **Search**: Find specific people by name or pubkey\n\nCombine these filters to answer questions like \"Who are my highly-trusted connections within 2 hops?\" or \"Show me only mutual follows.\"\n\n## Why Visualization Matters\n\nSeeing your trust network isn't just cool—it's useful. You can:\n\n- **Spot trusted bridges** who connect different parts of your network\n- **Discover clusters** of people who all know each other\n- **Identify outliers** who might be worth following directly\n- **Understand your reach** into different communities\n\nThe Web of Trust is a powerful concept, but it becomes truly intuitive when you can see it.\n\n## Try It Now\n\nReady to see your network? Head to the [Playground](/playground) and start exploring. Connect your Nostr account, and watch your trust network unfold before your eyes.\n\n---\n\n*Questions or feedback?

But with this growth comes a familiar challenge: **how do you separate signal from noise?**\n\n## The Problem with Open Networks\n\nOpen, permissionless networks are powerful precisely because anyone can participate. But this openness also means dealing with:\n\n- **Spam and bot accounts** flooding your feed\n- **Impersonators** pretending to be someone they're not\n- **Low-quality content** drowning out valuable discussions\n\nTraditional solutions rely on centralized moderation—a team deciding what's acceptable. But that defeats the purpose of a decentralized network.\n\n## Enter Web of Trust\n\nWeb of Trust takes a different approach. Instead of relying on a central authority, it leverages something you already have: **your social connections**.\n\nThe concept is simple:\n\n1. **You trust the people you follow**\n2. **They trust the people they follow**\n3. **Trust flows through these connections**\n\nIf someone is 1 hop away (you follow them directly), they're highly trusted. 2 hops away (a friend of a friend), somewhat trusted. 3 or more hops? Probably noise.\n\n```javascript\n// Check if someone is in your Web of Trust\nconst inNetwork = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Get their exact distance\nconst hops = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Get a trust score (0-1)\nconst score = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nOur browser extension builds a local graph of your social connections. When you visit any Nostr app, it can query this graph to determine trust levels for any pubkey.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nThe extension works with any Nostr app that implements the WoT API. No changes needed to your favorite client!\n</Callout>\n\n### Privacy First\n\nWe designed the system with privacy as a core principle:\n\n- **Local Mode**: Everything stays in your browser. Zero external requests.\n- **Remote Mode**: Only pubkey lookups—no content, no tracking.\n- **Hybrid Mode**: Best of both worlds with caching.\n\n## What's Next\n\nThis is just the beginning. We're working on:\n\n- **SDK for developers** to integrate WoT into their apps\n- **Oracle server** for apps that can't run client-side computations\n- **Advanced scoring** with mutual follows and bridging bonuses\n\n## Get Started\n\nReady to try it?

La censura, el sesgo y los algoritmos opacos erosionan la misma confianza que dicen proporcionar.\n\nWeb of Trust invierte este modelo.

Si confiabas en Alice, y Alice firmaba la clave de Bob, podías razonablemente confiar en Bob también.\n\nLa idea fue revolucionaria: **la confianza no necesita una autoridad certificadora. Puede emerger de las relaciones.**\n\nNostr lleva este concepto a las redes sociales. En lugar de firmar claves criptográficas, la confianza fluye a través de **relaciones de seguimiento** — una señal natural y sin fricción que ya existe en el protocolo.\n\n## Por Qué Nostr Lo Necesita\n\nNostr es un protocolo abierto. Cualquiera puede publicar. Nadie puede ser baneado a nivel de protocolo. Esta es su mayor fortaleza y su mayor desafío.\n\nSin ningún filtrado:\n\n- Los bots pueden inundar los relays con spam\n- Los impostores pueden copiar la identidad de cualquiera\n- El contenido de baja calidad compite en igualdad con publicaciones valiosas\n\nLas soluciones centralizadas (listas de bloqueo, moderación de admins) contradicen los principios de Nostr. Web of Trust proporciona una **alternativa descentralizada** — la red de confianza de cada usuario actúa como un filtro personalizado y auto-soberano.\n\n## Web of Trust en la Práctica\n\nCon [Nostr Web of Trust](/), tu extensión de navegador construye un grafo local de tus conexiones sociales. Cualquier app de Nostr puede consultar este grafo para responder preguntas como:\n\n- **¿Está esta persona en mi red?** Filtra a los completos desconocidos.\n- **¿A qué distancia está?** Prioriza las conexiones más cercanas.\n- **¿Cuál es su puntaje de confianza?** Toma decisiones con matices.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifica si un pubkey está en tu Web of Trust\nconst confiable = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén la distancia en saltos\nconst distancia = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén un puntaje de confianza normalizado (0 a 1)\nconst puntaje = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\nEl resultado: tu feed refleja **tus** juicios de confianza, no los de un algoritmo.\n\n## Privacidad por Diseño\n\nUn sistema de confianza que rastrea tu grafo social podría ser una pesadilla de privacidad. Por eso construimos tres modos:\n\n- **Modo Local** — Tu grafo permanece enteramente en tu navegador. Ningún servidor lo ve jamás.\n- **Modo Remoto** — Las consultas van a nuestro servidor oracle, pero solo se envían pubkeys. Sin contenido, sin metadatos.\n- **Modo Híbrido** — Caché local con respaldo remoto para claves desconocidas.\n\nTú eliges tu equilibrio entre rendimiento y privacidad.\n\n## Más Allá del Filtrado\n\nWeb of Trust no se trata solo de bloquear spam. Abre posibilidades como:\n\n- **Sistemas de reputación** — Pondera el contenido por el puntaje de confianza del autor\n- **Descubrimiento** — Encuentra cuentas valiosas a través de caminos de confianza\n- **Moderación colaborativa** — Las comunidades pueden definir límites de confianza compartidos\n- **Selección de relays** — Prefiere relays usados por contactos de confianza\n\nCuanto más profundo tu grafo de confianza, más útil se vuelve.\n\n## Pruébalo Tú Mismo\n\n¿Listo para ver tu red de confianza en acción?

          "content": "\nTu Web of Trust es más que una simple lista de personas que sigues. Es una red viva de conexiones, relaciones de confianza y caminos sociales que definen en quién confías y por qué. Pero hasta ahora, solo podías imaginar cómo se veía.\n\n**Llega el Playground.**\n\n## Ve Tu Red de Confianza Cobrar Vida\n\nEl Playground transforma tu grafo social abstracto en una experiencia visual e interactiva. Cada persona en tu red se convierte en un nodo. Cada relación de seguimiento se convierte en una conexión. ¿Y los niveles de confianza? Están pintados directamente en el lienzo.\n\n### Niveles de Confianza Codificados por Color\n\nDe un vistazo, puedes ver en quién confías más:\n\n- **Azul** — Eres tú, la raíz de tu red\n- **Verde** — Alta confianza (70%+), generalmente personas que sigues directamente\n- **Amarillo** — Confianza media (30-70%), amigos de amigos\n- **Rojo** — Baja confianza (menos del 30%), conexiones distantes en el borde de tu red\n\nEl sistema de colores hace instantáneamente claro dónde se ubica alguien en tu jerarquía de confianza. Sin números que analizar, sin listas que escanear—solo retroalimentación visual intuitiva.\n\n## Entendiendo Saltos y Caminos\n\nEl Playground organiza tu red por **distancia**—cuántos saltos se necesitan para llegar a alguien desde ti.\n\n- **1 salto**: Personas que sigues directamente (100% de peso de distancia)\n- **2 saltos**: Amigos de amigos (50% de peso)\n- **3 saltos**: Dos grados de separación (25% de peso)\n- **4+ saltos**: Red extendida (10% de peso)\n\nPero la distancia no lo es todo. El sistema también considera **caminos**—cuántas rutas diferentes llevan a la misma persona. Si sigues a alguien, y tres de tus amigos también lo siguen, eso son cuatro caminos. Más caminos significan más confianza.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nCuando seleccionas un nodo, verás detalles como \"2 saltos · 4 caminos · 65% confianza\"—dándote el contexto completo de cómo esa persona se relaciona con tu red.\n</Callout>\n\n## Expande y Explora\n\nEl verdadero poder del Playground es la **expansión interactiva**. No ves toda la red de una vez—eso sería abrumador. En cambio:\n\n1. **Comienza contigo mismo** como el nodo raíz\n2. **Haz clic para expandir** y cargar tus seguidores directos\n3. **Haz clic en cualquier nodo** para expandir sus conexiones\n4. **Profundiza**, hasta 3 saltos en la red\n\nEsta carga bajo demanda significa que puedes explorar exactamente las partes de tu red que te interesan, sin esperar a que miles de nodos se carguen de antemano.\n\n## Elige Tu Dimensión: 2D o 3D\n\nCada persona piensa diferente. Algunos prefieren una vista plana y rápida. Otros quieren sumergirse en un espacio inmersivo. El Playground soporta ambos:\n\n### Modo 2D\n\nLa vista 2D renderiza en un lienzo con nodos organizados en círculos concéntricos por distancia de saltos. Es rápida, responsiva y puede manejar hasta 10,000 nodos. Perfecta para:\n\n- Vistas generales rápidas de la estructura de tu red\n- Encontrar personas específicas\n- Rendimiento en dispositivos de gama baja\n\n### Modo 3D\n\nLa vista 3D usa WebGL para renderizar tu red en espacio tridimensional. Orbita alrededor, acércate y explora tu red como si navegaras una galaxia. Ideal para:\n\n- Exploración inmersiva\n- Entender patrones de conexión complejos\n- Descubrir clusters y comunidades\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nEn modo 3D, usa arrastrar-izquierdo para rotar, arrastrar-derecho para desplazar y scroll para zoom. Los tamaños de los nodos se basan en la confianza—nodos más grandes son más confiables.\n</Callout>\n\n## Filtra y Enfoca\n\nLas redes grandes pueden ser ruidosas. El Playground te da herramientas para filtrar lo que importa:\n\n- **Umbral de Confianza**: Solo muestra nodos por encima de cierto porcentaje de confianza\n- **Límite de Distancia**: Limita los saltos máximos mostrados (1-5)\n- **Tipos de Conexión**: Alterna entre seguidores, silenciados, o muestra solo conexiones mutuas\n- **Búsqueda**: Encuentra personas específicas por nombre o pubkey\n\nCombina estos filtros para responder preguntas como \"¿Quiénes son mis conexiones de alta confianza dentro de 2 saltos?\" o \"Muéstrame solo los seguidores mutuos.\"\n\n## Por Qué Importa la Visualización\n\nVer tu red de confianza no es solo genial—es útil. Puedes:\n\n- **Detectar puentes de confianza** que conectan diferentes partes de tu red\n- **Descubrir clusters** de personas que se conocen entre sí\n- **Identificar valores atípicos** que podrían valer la pena seguir directamente\n- **Entender tu alcance** hacia diferentes comunidades\n\nWeb of Trust es un concepto poderoso, pero se vuelve verdaderamente intuitivo cuando puedes verlo.\n\n## Pruébalo Ahora\n\n¿Listo para ver tu red? Ve al [Playground](/playground) y comienza a explorar. Conecta tu cuenta de Nostr y observa cómo tu red de confianza se despliega ante tus ojos.\n\n---\n\n*¿Preguntas o comentarios?

Pero con este crecimiento viene un desafío familiar: **¿cómo separas la señal del ruido?**\n\n## El Problema con las Redes Abiertas\n\nLas redes abiertas y sin permisos son poderosas precisamente porque cualquiera puede participar. Pero esta apertura también significa lidiar con:\n\n- **Spam y cuentas bot** inundando tu feed\n- **Impostores** pretendiendo ser alguien que no son\n- **Contenido de baja calidad** ahogando discusiones valiosas\n\nLas soluciones tradicionales dependen de la moderación centralizada—un equipo decidiendo qué es aceptable. Pero eso contradice el propósito de una red descentralizada.\n\n## Llega Web of Trust\n\nWeb of Trust toma un enfoque diferente. En lugar de depender de una autoridad central, aprovecha algo que ya tienes: **tus conexiones sociales**.\n\nEl concepto es simple:\n\n1. **Confías en las personas que sigues**\n2. **Ellas confían en las personas que siguen**\n3. **La confianza fluye a través de estas conexiones**\n\nSi alguien está a 1 salto (los sigues directamente), son altamente confiables. ¿A 2 saltos (amigo de un amigo)? Algo confiables. ¿3 o más saltos? Probablemente ruido.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifica si alguien está en tu Web of Trust\nconst enRed = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén su distancia exacta\nconst saltos = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtén un puntaje de confianza (0-1)\nconst puntaje = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\n## Cómo Funciona\n\nNuestra extensión de navegador construye un grafo local de tus conexiones sociales.

Cero solicitudes externas.\n- **Modo Remoto**: Solo consultas de pubkey—sin contenido, sin rastreo.\n- **Modo Híbrido**: Lo mejor de ambos mundos con caché.\n\n## ¿Qué Sigue?\n\nEsto es solo el comienzo. Estamos trabajando en:\n\n- **SDK para desarrolladores** para integrar WoT en sus apps\n- **Servidor Oracle** para apps que no pueden ejecutar cálculos del lado del cliente\n- **Puntuación avanzada** con seguidores mutuos y bonificaciones de puente\n\n## Comienza\n\n¿Listo para probarlo?

          "content": "\nA confiança é a base de toda interação online. Quando você lê uma publicação, segue uma conta ou compartilha conteúdo, está fazendo um julgamento sobre quem merece sua atenção. Mas como fazer esse julgamento em escala, sem que uma empresa decida por você?\n\nEssa é a pergunta que o **Web of Trust** responde.\n\n## Confiança Sem Guardiões\n\nNa maioria das plataformas, a confiança é centralizada. Uma empresa verifica contas, cura feeds e decide quem é banido. Funciona — até parar de funcionar. Censura, viés e algoritmos opacos corroem a mesma confiança que dizem fornecer.\n\nWeb of Trust inverte esse modelo. Em vez de uma autoridade central, **você** é a raiz da sua própria rede de confiança. As pessoas que você segue são seu primeiro círculo de confiança. As pessoas que elas seguem formam seu segundo círculo. E assim por diante.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nPense nisso como na vida real. Você confia nos seus amigos. Confia um pouco nos amigos dos seus amigos. Um estranho a cinco apertos de mão de distância? Provavelmente você ia querer alguma prova antes de confiar nele.\n</Callout>\n\n## Como Funciona\n\nWeb of Trust mapeia suas conexões sociais em um grafo direcionado com níveis de confiança mensuráveis:\n\n- **1 salto** — Pessoas que você segue diretamente. Maior confiança.\n- **2 saltos** — Amigos de amigos. Confiança moderada.\n- **3 saltos** — Dois graus de separação. Menor confiança.\n- **Além de 3 saltos** — Essencialmente desconhecidos para sua rede.\n\nCada salto reduz a pontuação de confiança. Mas não se trata apenas de distância — a quantidade de **caminhos** também importa. Se cinco dos seus contatos de confiança seguem a mesma pessoa, essa pessoa tem mais credibilidade do que alguém alcançado por uma única cadeia.\n\n## A Origem da Ideia\n\nWeb of Trust não é novo. <WikiLink href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann\" extract=\"Criador do PGP, o software de criptografia de e-mail mais utilizado do mundo, e uma figura-chave no movimento de criptografia de chave pública.\">Phil Zimmermann</WikiLink> introduziu o conceito em 1991 com <WikiLink href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP\" extract=\"Um programa de criptografia que fornece privacidade criptográfica e autenticação para comunicação de dados, criado por Phil Zimmermann em 1991.\">PGP</WikiLink> (Pretty Good Privacy), um sistema para criptografar e-mail. No <WikiLink href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_de_confiança\" extract=\"Um modelo de confiança descentralizado usado no PGP e outros sistemas, onde a confiança é estabelecida através de uma rede de chaves mutuamente assinadas.\">Web of Trust</WikiLink> do PGP, os usuários assinavam as chaves públicas uns dos outros para atestar suas identidades. Se você confiava na Alice, e Alice assinava a chave do Bob, você podia razoavelmente confiar no Bob também.\n\nA ideia foi revolucionária: **a confiança não precisa de uma autoridade certificadora. Ela pode emergir dos relacionamentos.**\n\nO Nostr traz esse conceito para as redes sociais. Em vez de assinar chaves criptográficas, a confiança flui através de **relações de seguimento** — um sinal natural e sem fricção que já existe no protocolo.\n\n## Por Que o Nostr Precisa Disso\n\nO Nostr é um protocolo aberto. Qualquer um pode publicar. Ninguém pode ser banido no nível do protocolo. Essa é sua maior força e seu maior desafio.\n\nSem nenhuma filtragem:\n\n- Bots podem inundar relays com spam\n- Impostores podem copiar a identidade de qualquer pessoa\n- Conteúdo de baixa qualidade compete igualmente com publicações valiosas\n\nSoluções centralizadas (listas de bloqueio, moderação de admins) contradizem os princípios do Nostr. Web of Trust fornece uma **alternativa descentralizada** — a rede de confiança de cada usuário age como um filtro personalizado e auto-soberano.\n\n## Web of Trust na Prática\n\nCom o [Nostr Web of Trust](/), sua extensão de navegador constrói um grafo local das suas conexões sociais. Qualquer app Nostr pode consultar esse grafo para responder perguntas como:\n\n- **Essa pessoa está na minha rede?** Filtre completos desconhecidos.\n- **A que distância ela está?** Priorize conexões mais próximas.\n- **Qual é a pontuação de confiança?** Tome decisões com nuances.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifique se um pubkey está no seu Web of Trust\nconst confiavel = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha a distância em saltos\nconst distancia = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha uma pontuação de confiança normalizada (0 a 1)\nconst pontuacao = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\nO resultado: seu feed reflete **seus** julgamentos de confiança, não os de um algoritmo.\n\n## Privacidade por Design\n\nUm sistema de confiança que rastreia seu grafo social poderia ser um pesadelo de privacidade. Por isso construímos três modos:\n\n- **Modo Local** — Seu grafo permanece inteiramente no seu navegador. Nenhum servidor jamais o vê.\n- **Modo Remoto** — As consultas vão para nosso servidor oracle, mas apenas pubkeys são enviados. Sem conteúdo, sem metadados.\n- **Modo Híbrido** — Cache local com fallback remoto para chaves desconhecidas.\n\nVocê escolhe seu equilíbrio entre desempenho e privacidade.\n\n## Além da Filtragem\n\nWeb of Trust não é apenas sobre bloquear spam. Abre possibilidades como:\n\n- **Sistemas de reputação** — Pondere conteúdo pela pontuação de confiança do autor\n- **Descoberta** — Encontre contas valiosas através de caminhos de confiança\n- **Moderação colaborativa** — Comunidades podem definir limites de confiança compartilhados\n- **Seleção de relays** — Prefira relays usados por contatos de confiança\n\nQuanto mais profundo seu grafo de confiança, mais útil ele se torna.\n\n## Experimente Você Mesmo\n\nPronto para ver sua rede de confiança em ação?

          "content": "\nSeu Web of Trust é mais do que uma simples lista de pessoas que você segue. É uma rede viva de conexões, relacionamentos de confiança e caminhos sociais que definem em quem você confia e por quê. Mas até agora, você só podia imaginar como ela se parecia.\n\n**Conheça o Playground.**\n\n## Veja Sua Rede de Confiança Ganhar Vida\n\nO Playground transforma seu grafo social abstrato em uma experiência visual e interativa. Cada pessoa na sua rede se torna um nó. Cada relacionamento de seguimento se torna uma conexão. E os níveis de confiança? Estão pintados diretamente na tela.\n\n### Níveis de Confiança Codificados por Cor\n\nDe relance, você pode ver em quem mais confia:\n\n- **Azul** — É você, a raiz da sua rede\n- **Verde** — Alta confiança (70%+), geralmente pessoas que você segue diretamente\n- **Amarelo** — Confiança média (30-70%), amigos de amigos\n- **Vermelho** — Baixa confiança (menos de 30%), conexões distantes na borda da sua rede\n\nO sistema de cores torna instantaneamente claro onde alguém está na sua hierarquia de confiança. Sem números para analisar, sem listas para examinar—apenas feedback visual intuitivo.\n\n## Entendendo Saltos e Caminhos\n\nO Playground organiza sua rede por **distância**—quantos saltos são necessários para alcançar alguém a partir de você.\n\n- **1 salto**: Pessoas que você segue diretamente (100% de peso de distância)\n- **2 saltos**: Amigos de amigos (50% de peso)\n- **3 saltos**: Dois graus de separação (25% de peso)\n- **4+ saltos**: Rede estendida (10% de peso)\n\nMas distância não é tudo. O sistema também considera **caminhos**—quantas rotas diferentes levam à mesma pessoa. Se você segue alguém, e três dos seus amigos também seguem, são quatro caminhos. Mais caminhos significam mais confiança.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nQuando você seleciona um nó, verá detalhes como \"2 saltos · 4 caminhos · 65% confiança\"—dando o contexto completo de como essa pessoa se relaciona com sua rede.\n</Callout>\n\n## Expanda e Explore\n\nO verdadeiro poder do Playground é a **expansão interativa**. Você não vê toda a rede de uma vez—isso seria avassalador. Em vez disso:\n\n1. **Comece com você mesmo** como o nó raiz\n2. **Clique para expandir** e carregar seus seguidores diretos\n3. **Clique em qualquer nó** para expandir suas conexões\n4. **Vá mais fundo**, até 3 saltos na rede\n\nEsse carregamento sob demanda significa que você pode explorar exatamente as partes da sua rede que lhe interessam, sem esperar milhares de nós carregarem antecipadamente.\n\n## Escolha Sua Dimensão: 2D ou 3D\n\nCada pessoa pensa diferente. Alguns preferem uma visão plana e rápida. Outros querem mergulhar em um espaço imersivo. O Playground suporta ambos:\n\n### Modo 2D\n\nA visualização 2D renderiza em uma tela com nós organizados em círculos concêntricos por distância de saltos. É rápida, responsiva e pode lidar com até 10.000 nós. Perfeita para:\n\n- Visões gerais rápidas da estrutura da sua rede\n- Encontrar pessoas específicas\n- Performance em dispositivos de menor capacidade\n\n### Modo 3D\n\nA visualização 3D usa WebGL para renderizar sua rede em espaço tridimensional. Orbite, aproxime e explore sua rede como se navegasse uma galáxia. Ideal para:\n\n- Exploração imersiva\n- Entender padrões de conexão complexos\n- Descobrir clusters e comunidades\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nNo modo 3D, use arrastar-esquerdo para rotacionar, arrastar-direito para deslocar e scroll para zoom. Os tamanhos dos nós são baseados na confiança—nós maiores são mais confiáveis.\n</Callout>\n\n## Filtre e Foque\n\nRedes grandes podem ser ruidosas. O Playground oferece ferramentas para filtrar o que importa:\n\n- **Limite de Confiança**: Mostre apenas nós acima de certa porcentagem de confiança\n- **Limite de Distância**: Limite os saltos máximos exibidos (1-5)\n- **Tipos de Conexão**: Alterne entre seguidores, silenciados, ou mostre apenas conexões mútuas\n- **Busca**: Encontre pessoas específicas por nome ou pubkey\n\nCombine esses filtros para responder perguntas como \"Quem são minhas conexões de alta confiança dentro de 2 saltos?\" ou \"Mostre-me apenas os seguidores mútuos.\"\n\n## Por Que a Visualização Importa\n\nVer sua rede de confiança não é apenas legal—é útil. Você pode:\n\n- **Identificar pontes de confiança** que conectam diferentes partes da sua rede\n- **Descobrir clusters** de pessoas que se conhecem\n- **Identificar outliers** que podem valer a pena seguir diretamente\n- **Entender seu alcance** em diferentes comunidades\n\nWeb of Trust é um conceito poderoso, mas se torna verdadeiramente intuitivo quando você pode vê-lo.\n\n## Experimente Agora\n\nPronto para ver sua rede? Vá ao [Playground](/playground) e comece a explorar. Conecte sua conta Nostr e observe sua rede de confiança se desdobrar diante dos seus olhos.\n\n---\n\n*Perguntas ou feedback?

          "content": "\nO ecossistema Nostr está crescendo rapidamente. Todos os dias, milhares de novos usuários entram na rede, criando notas, compartilhando conteúdo e construindo conexões. Mas com esse crescimento vem um desafio familiar: **como você separa o sinal do ruído?**\n\n## O Problema com Redes Abertas\n\nRedes abertas e sem permissão são poderosas precisamente porque qualquer um pode participar. Mas essa abertura também significa lidar com:\n\n- **Spam e contas bot** inundando seu feed\n- **Impostores** fingindo ser alguém que não são\n- **Conteúdo de baixa qualidade** afogando discussões valiosas\n\nSoluções tradicionais dependem de moderação centralizada—uma equipe decidindo o que é aceitável. Mas isso contradiz o propósito de uma rede descentralizada.\n\n## Entra o Web of Trust\n\nWeb of Trust adota uma abordagem diferente. Em vez de depender de uma autoridade central, ele aproveita algo que você já tem: **suas conexões sociais**.\n\nO conceito é simples:\n\n1. **Você confia nas pessoas que segue**\n2. **Elas confiam nas pessoas que seguem**\n3. **A confiança flui através dessas conexões**\n\nSe alguém está a 1 salto de distância (você os segue diretamente), são altamente confiáveis. 2 saltos (amigo de um amigo)? Algo confiáveis. 3 ou mais saltos? Provavelmente ruído.\n\n```javascript\n// Verifique se alguém está no seu Web of Trust\nconst naRede = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha a distância exata\nconst saltos = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);\n\n// Obtenha uma pontuação de confiança (0-1)\nconst pontuacao = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);\n```\n\n## Como Funciona\n\nNossa extensão de navegador constrói um grafo local das suas conexões sociais. Quando você visita qualquer app Nostr, ela pode consultar esse grafo para determinar níveis de confiança para qualquer pubkey.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nA extensão funciona com qualquer app Nostr que implemente a API WoT. Não são necessárias mudanças no seu cliente favorito!\n</Callout>\n\n### Privacidade em Primeiro Lugar\n\nProjetamos o sistema com privacidade como princípio fundamental:\n\n- **Modo Local**: Tudo permanece no seu navegador. Zero requisições externas.\n- **Modo Remoto**: Apenas consultas de pubkey—sem conteúdo, sem rastreamento.\n- **Modo Híbrido**: O melhor dos dois mundos com cache.\n\n## O Que Vem a Seguir\n\nIsso é apenas o começo. Estamos trabalhando em:\n\n- **SDK para desenvolvedores** para integrar WoT em seus apps\n- **Servidor Oracle** para apps que não podem executar cálculos do lado do cliente\n- **Pontuação avançada** com seguidores mútuos e bônus de ponte\n\n## Comece Agora\n\nPronto para experimentar? [Baixe a extensão](/download) e comece a filtrar sua experiência no Nostr baseado em conexões humanas reais.\n\n---\n\n*Tem perguntas?
