# Nostr Web of Trust

> Filter spam and find trusted content on Nostr using your trust network. A decentralized reputation system that helps you see better content without relying on central moderators.

Nostr Web of Trust (WoT) helps you filter spam and find trustworthy content by measuring how close people are to you in your social network. People you follow = 1 hop (high trust), people they follow = 2 hops (medium trust), beyond 3 hops = likely noise.

## Core Concepts

- **Trust Score**: Calculated based on social distance and number of paths connecting two users
- **Distance**: Number of hops between two pubkeys in the follow graph
- **Web of Trust**: The network of follows that determines trust relationships

## Trust Score Formula

```
score = base × distance_weight × (1 + path_bonus)
```

Distance weights: 1 hop = 100%, 2 hops = 60%, 3 hops = 30%, 4+ hops = 10%

## API Reference

### Browser Extension API

```javascript
// Get distance in hops
await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(targetPubkey)

// Get trust score (0-1)
await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(targetPubkey)

// Check if user is in Web of Trust
await window.nostr.wot.isInWoT(targetPubkey)
```

### JavaScript SDK

```javascript
import { NostrWoT } from 'nostr-wot-sdk'

const wot = new NostrWoT({ userPubkey: 'your-pubkey' })
await wot.getTrustScore(targetPubkey)
await wot.getDistance(targetPubkey)
```

### Oracle REST API

```
GET /distance?from={pubkey}&to={pubkey}
POST /distance/batch
GET /stats
```
